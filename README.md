### Part 3:
#### 3.2 firefly visualizer
Overview:
The brightness of the LED of RP2040 will change based on the 'clear' value of the APDS9960's brightness reading.

### Part 4:
#### 4.2 Mouse cursor moving horizontally based on the APDS9960's latest brightness reading
Overview:
Mouse cursor will move to the left in strong light, and will move to right in the dark. In the natural environment, mouse cursor does not move. To be specifical, when the 'clear' value of the brightness is over 45000, the mouse cursor will move forward left. When the 'clear' value of the brightness is less than 1000, the mouse cursor will move forward right. If the 'clear' value of the brightness is between 1000 and 45000, the mouse cursor won't move.

#### 4.3 "O" & "backspace" input based on the brightness reading
Overview:
I have set comparing loop of the clear value of the brightness, when the 'clear' value of the brightness is increasing, the computer will type the letter "O" autometically. When the 'clear' value of the brightness is decreasing, the computer will send the "backspace" autometically. If the 'clear' value of the brightness didn't change, there is no any commands sent (For example, keeping the sensor in the dark)

#### 4.4 Custom real-time visualizer
Overview:
In this section, I accomplished send "UP_ARROW","DOWN_ARROW","LEFT_ARROW","RIGHT_ARROW" commands via gesture of "up", "down", "left", "right" individually based on the APDS9960's gesture reading.
