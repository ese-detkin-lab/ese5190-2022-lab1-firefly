Just like the example in 4.3, when the light index becomes higher, the slide of index combined with 'o' will be longer. Contrarily, if the light index is lower, the slide will be shorter! By lifting or descending my hand to regulate the light index, the sensor APDS-9960 will receive the light index and interact with RP2040 board through i2c contract. Through this process, we can reach the aim of indicating the light index on screen finally.

The following diagram will explain this process vividly.
