## 3.3. Firefly 

Use *APDS9960* to detect the light from Firefly on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=413&v=BtCGtaMrBXQ&feature=youtu.be) and represent its light via RGB LED in the *RP2040 board*.



## 4.4. Custom Visualizer

Use *APDS9960* to detect the distance and represent it via RGB LED in the *RP2040 board* and my computer screen.

The protocol between APDS 9960 and RP2040 is I2C and the protocol between RP2040 and computer is USB HID protocol. 



**Rule:**

1. If you get closer to the sensor, then it prints "Get close" and emits Yellow light.
2. If you get far away from the sensor, then it prints "Get further" and emits Green light.
3. If the distance is so close(greater than 200), then it prints "Need to stop" and emits Red light.
