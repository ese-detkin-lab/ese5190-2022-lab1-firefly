## Overview

Light Controlled Keyboard Input is achieved by connecting Adafruit QT Py RP 2040 and APDS 9600. APDS 9600 is used for detecting strength of the received light, while RP 2040 sends respective instructions depending on the light strength to PC to produce output from keyboard.

On the one hand, when the light received by the sensor is brighter, character “O” would be printed. 

On the other hand, when the light becomes weaker, character “I” would be printed.
